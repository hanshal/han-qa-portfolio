## 👤 About Me

I’m a versatile Software QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both manual and automation testing across agile, cross-functional teams. My expertise spans functional, regression, exploratory, API, and mobile testing for web and hybrid applications. I’ve worked with companies like **Ringier South Africa** and **SD Worx Mauritius**, where I helped build scalable and maintainable test frameworks.

In recent years, I’ve focused on enhancing testing efficiency by integrating **GenAI (ChatGPT)** into test script generation, developing CI-based regression suites, and aligning QA strategies with real-world product usage using **Google Analytics**, **Datadog**, and **Microsoft Clarity**.
