## 👤 About Me

I’m a versatile Software QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both manual and automation testing across agile, cross-functional teams. My expertise spans functional, regression, exploratory, API, and mobile testing for web and hybrid applications. I’ve worked with companies like **Ringier South Africa** and **SD Worx Mauritius**, where I helped build scalable and maintainable test frameworks.

In recent years, I’ve focused on enhancing testing efficiency by integrating **GenAI (ChatGPT)** into test script generation, developing CI-based regression suites, and aligning QA strategies with real-world product usage using **Google Analytics**, **Datadog**, and **Microsoft Clarity**.

## 🧠 My QA Philosophy: Curiosity Drives Quality

While tools, frameworks, and test cases are essential, I believe curiosity is the most underrated and most powerful skill in QA.

A curious tester doesn’t just execute scripts. They explore. They question. They think like the user and look beyond what's written in the requirements. It's this mindset that often uncovers the edge cases and hidden bugs others miss.

Some of the most impactful issues I’ve found weren’t from planned test cases but from asking “what if?” and digging just a little deeper.
